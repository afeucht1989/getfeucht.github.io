**Lesson Plan: Introduction to Cyber Security Principles**

**Objective:** Students will understand fundamental CyberSecurity First Principles and Concept (Simplicity, Minimization, Data Hiding, Layering, and Least Privilege) and their application in protecting digital information.

**Grade Level:** High School (9th-10th grade)

**Materials Needed:**

*Whiteboard and markers

*Projector and screen

*Computers or tablets with internet access (optional, for research)

*Handouts: Definitions and examples of each principle

**Lesson Duration: 80 minutes / two class periods**

**Procedure:**

**1. Introduction (15 minutes)**

Begin by discussing the importance of cyber security in today's digital world. 

Ask students if they have ever heard of or experienced any cyber security incidents (e.g., hacking, phishing, identity theft).

Introduce the objective of the lesson: to learn about five key cyber security principles that help protect digital information. 


**2. Explanation of Cyber Security Principles (25 minutes)**

*Simplicity: Explain that simpler systems are easier to understand, manage, and secure. Complexity often introduces vulnerabilities. Use examples such as using strong, simple passwords versus complex ones that are hard to remember.

*Minimization: Discuss the principle of minimizing the attack surface by reducing unnecessary features or components that could be exploited. Give examples such as disabling unused services on computers or applications.

*Data Hiding: Explain the importance of protecting sensitive information by encrypting it or storing it securely. Use examples such as encrypting emails containing personal information.

*Layering: Discuss the concept of defense in depth, where multiple layers of security measures (e.g., firewalls, antivirus software, user authentication) are used to protect against different types of threats.

*Least Privilege: Explain that users and programs should only have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks. Use examples such as not granting administrative privileges to all users on a computer network.


**3. Group Activity (20 minutes)**
*Divide students into small groups. Assign each group one of the cyber security principles to research further.

*Instruct students to discuss and find real-life examples where their assigned principle could have prevented a cyber security incident. They should prepare to present their findings to the class.


**4. Presentations and Discussion (15 minutes)**
*Have each group present their findings and examples to the class.

*Lead a discussion on each presentation, encouraging students to ask questions and provide feedback on how each principle contributes to overall cyber security.


**5. Conclusion and Wrap-Up (10 minutes)**
*Summarize the key points of the lesson: Simplicity, Minimization, Data Hiding, Layering, and Least Privilege are fundamental principles that help protect digital information.

*Discuss with students how they can apply these principles in their own digital lives to stay safe online.

**Homework (Optional):**
*Ask students to research a recent cyber security incident in the news and write a short paragraph on how applying one of the discussed principles could have prevented or mitigated the incident.

**Assessment:**
*Assess students based on their participation in discussions, group activity, and the quality of their presentations.

*Review their understanding through any homework assignments or follow-up questions during subsequent classes.

**Note:** Adjust the complexity and depth of discussion based on the students' familiarity with technology and cyber security concepts.
